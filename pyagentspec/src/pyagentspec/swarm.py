    Defines a ``Swarm`` conversational component.

    A ``Swarm`` is a multi-agent conversational component in which each agent determines
    the next agent to be executed, based on a list of pre-defined relationships.
    Agents in Swarm can be any ``AgenticComponent``.

    When ``True``:
        Agents can *handoff* the conversation â€” transferring the entire message history between the user and one agent to another agent within the Swarm.
        This allows different agents to take over the user interaction while maintaining context.
        Agents can still exchange messages with each other as in ``handoff=False`` mode.
