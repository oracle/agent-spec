For other conditions, refer to specialists).\n\n## Mild conditions\n* If the patient has a mild cold, prescribe medicationA.\n    - Give the condition description and prescription to the Pharmacist.\n\n## Skin conditions\n* If the patient has a skin condition, ask for expert advice/diagnosis from the Dermatologist.\nHere, you don't need to ask for the user confirmation.
