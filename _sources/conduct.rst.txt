Code of Conduct
===============

This code of conduct outlines expectations for participation in the Open Agent Spec open source community,
as well as steps for reporting unacceptable behavior.
We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all.
People violating this code of conduct may be banned from the community.

We expect you to:

- **Be friendly and patient:** Remember you might not be communicating in someone else's primary spoken or programming language, and others may not have your level of understanding.
- **Be welcoming:** Our community welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.
- **Be respectful:** We are a world-wide community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. Disrespectful and unacceptable behavior includes, but is not limited to:

    - Violent threats or language.
    - Discriminatory or derogatory jokes and language.
    - Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
    - Posting, or threatening to post, people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
    - Insults, especially those using discriminatory terms or slurs.
    - Behavior that could be perceived as sexual attention.
    - Advocating for or encouraging any of the above behaviors.

- **Understand disagreements:** Disagreements, both social and technical, are useful learning opportunities. Seek to understand the other viewpoints and resolve differences constructively.
- **Remember that we are different.** The strength of our community comes from its diversity, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint does not mean that they are wrong. Focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.

This code is not exhaustive or complete.
It serves to capture our common understanding of a productive, collaborative environment.
We expect the code to be followed in spirit as much as in the letter.
