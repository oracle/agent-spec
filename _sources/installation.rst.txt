Installation
============

You can find all versions and supported platforms of |project| in the :package_index:`\ `.

To install version |package_name| |stable_release|, run:

.. code-block:: bash
    :substitutions:

    pip install "|package_name|==|stable_release|"

Installing with ``pip`` pulls prebuilt binary wheels on supported platforms.

.. only:: builder_html

    The list of package versions used in the internal CI is available at:
    :download:`constraints.txt <../../../pyagentspec/constraints/constraints.txt>`

    To install |project| using these exact versions, download the file and run:

    .. code-block:: bash
        :substitutions:

        pip install "|package_name|==|stable_release|" -c constraints.txt


Supported platforms
-------------------

|project| strives for compatibility with major platforms and environments wherever possible.

How to read the table:

* Unsupported: the package or one of its dependencies is not compatible with the Python version;
* Untested: the package and its dependencies are compatible with the Python version, but they are not tested;
* Supported: the package and its dependencies are compatible with the Python version, and the package is tested on that version.

What do *Supported*, *Untested* and *Unsupported* mean?

* *Unsupported*: The package or one of its dependencies is not compatible with the Python version.
* *Untested*: The package and its dependencies are compatible with the Python version, but they are not tested.
* *Supported*: The package and its dependencies are compatible with the Python version, and the package is tested on that version.
