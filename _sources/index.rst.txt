Open Agent Specification, Agent Spec
====================================

.. container:: gradient-background

   .. container:: description

      Open Agent Specification (Agent Spec) is a portable language for defining agentic
      systems. It defines building blocks for standalone agents and structured agentic workflows as well
      as common ways of composing them into multi-agent systems.

          :class: benefit-icon
          :alt: Flexible

      **Flexible**
      Agent Spec lets you focus on designing an agentic solution — ranging from single agents
      to multi-agent systems and tailored structured flows — ensuring a strong fit for your needs.

          :alt: Reliable & Consistent

      **Reliable & Consistent**
      With Agent Spec, each agent follows an explicit specification, promoting uniform behavior across
      frameworks and increasing confidence in important workflows.

          :class: benefit-icon
          :alt: Extensible

      **Extensible**
      Agent Spec is designed to be extensible, allowing developers to define custom components to meet
      their specific needs. This flexibility lets Agent Spec adapt to a wide range of requirements.

          :alt: Modular & Reusable

      **Modular & Reusable**
      Agent Spec’s component-based design lets agents and flows be developed independently, then mixed and
      matched like building blocks, making reuse and composition into complex assistants faster and simpler.

          :alt: Portable Across Frameworks

      **Portable Across Frameworks**
      Author agents once and run them with any compatible runtime. Agent Spec decouples
      design from execution, helping deliver more predictable behavior across frameworks.

      **Evaluation-Ready**
      By defining agents with a standardized representation, Agent Spec is designed to streamline
      testing and side-by-side comparisons on frameworks that support the specifications.

        .. rubric:: How does Agent Spec fits the modern Agentic Ecosystem
            :class: detail-title

        Agent Spec aims to streamline the architecture and design of agentic assistants
        and workflows, serving as an intermediate representation that abstracts away
        implementation details of specific agentic frameworks.

        While protocols like MCP and A2A standardize tool or resource provisioning
        as well as inter-agent communication, Agent Spec complements these efforts by
        enabling standardized configuration of components related to agentic system design and execution in general.

      Agents are LLM-powered assistants that can converse with users, use external tools,
      and cooperate with other agents, autonomously managing their processes and strategies
      to flexibly achieve assigned tasks.

      Flows are structured assistants composed of connected nodes that form coherent action sequences.
      Each node performs a specific function, supporting controllable and efficient execution of business
      processes and tasks.
