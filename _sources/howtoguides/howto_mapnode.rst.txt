How to Do Map and Reduce Operations in Flows
============================================

Map-Reduce is a programming model essential for efficiently processing large datasets across distributed systems.
It is widely used in software engineering to enhance data processing speed and scalability.

Agent Spec supports the Map and Reduce operations in Flows, using the :ref:`MapNode <mapnode>`.
This guide will show you how to use :ref:`MapNode <mapnode>` to perform an operation on **all elements of a list**

Basic implementation
====================

Assuming you want to summarize a few articles.
You have the option to generate the summary with the :ref:`LlmNode <llmnode>` class:

.. literalinclude:: ../code_examples/howto_mapnode.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: .. start-##_Create_the_Flow_for_the_MapNode
    :end-before: .. end-##_Create_the_Flow_for_the_MapNode

This step takes a single article, and generates a summary.
Since you have a list of articles, use the ``MapNode`` class to generate a summary for each article.
Pay attention in using the right names for inputs and outputs of the ``MapNode``:
according to the Agent Spec language specification, you should prepend the ``iterated_`` prefix
to the inputs of the sub-flow that should be "mapped", and the ``collected_`` prefix to the outputs
of the sub-flow that should be "reduced".

In this case we select the ``append`` reduction method for the only subflow output we have (i.e., ``summary``).
This corresponds to the default behavior of the ``MapNode``, so we don't need to specify anything.

Please, refer to the :ref:`Agent Spec specification <agentspecspec>` for more information.

.. literalinclude:: ../code_examples/howto_mapnode.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: .. start-##_Create_the_MapNode
    :end-before: .. end-##_Create_the_MapNode

The code above will connect:

- the ``article`` input of the sub-flow to the ``iterated_article`` input of the ``MapNode``
- the ``summary`` output of the sub-flow to the ``collected_summary`` output of the ``MapNode``

Once this is done, you can create the flow for the ``MapNode``:

.. literalinclude:: ../code_examples/howto_mapnode.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: .. start-##_Create_the_final_Flow
    :end-before: .. end-##_Create_the_final_Flow

Agent Spec Serialization
========================

You can export the assistant configuration using the :ref:`AgentSpecSerializer <serialize>`.

.. literalinclude:: ../code_examples/howto_mapnode.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: .. start-export-config-to-agentspec
    :end-before: .. end-export-config-to-agentspec
